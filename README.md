🚀 Welcome to My RL Odyssey! 🤖

Prepare to join me on an epic journey into the heart of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and programming. 
In this repository, I'll share my personal quest for knowledge and mastery.

**🛠️ Setting the Stage**
- **Loading OpenAI Gym Environments**: Watch as I lay the foundation for my AI's adventures by setting up its virtual playground.
- **Understanding OpenAI Gym Environments**: Together, we'll unravel the mysteries of Gym environments, observations, and actions.

**🤖 Training My Digital Companion**
- **Train a Reinforcement Learning Model**: The heart of the journey! I'll chronicle the highs and lows as I train my very own RL agent.
  
- **Saving and Reloading Environments**: Like a traveler keeping a journal, I'll learn to save my AI's progress and continue the quest.

**🔍 Testing and Proving**
- **Evaluating RL Models**: How do we measure progress? Join me in assessing my AI's performance and making it even smarter.
- **Testing the Agent**: It's time to send my AI into the arena to see if it's truly battle-ready.
- **Viewing Logs in Tensorboard**: Dive into the magic of data visualization as we explore our AI's journey.


**🚀 Boosting Performance**
- **Callbacks, Alternate Algorithms, Neural Networks**: We're leveling up! Together, we'll explore advanced techniques like training callbacks, policy adjustments, and diverse RL algorithms.


**🚀 My Grand Projects**
- I'm not just here to learn; I'm here to build! Stay tuned for exciting RL projects that showcase the fruits of my journey.
-  I will pick about two or more project and work on. I am still deciding what to include and remove from the projects, but i hope they turn out great regardless.


Join me on this epic RL odyssey! Together, we'll conquer the challenges of RL and emerge as masters of this fascinating domain. 🌟 Let's make this journey unforgettable!
